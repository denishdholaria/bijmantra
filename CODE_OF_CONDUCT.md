# Bijmantra Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Ethical Use Commitment

**All contributors, users, and community members must commit to the ethical use
of Bijmantra as defined in our ETHICAL_USE_POLICY.md.**

### Prohibited Uses

Bijmantra shall NEVER be used for:

- **Terminator Technology** - Technologies that produce sterile seeds
- **Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs)** - Any technology that restricts
  the natural reproductive capacity of plants
- **Traitor Technology** - Technologies requiring proprietary chemicals to activate traits
- **Any seed termination technology** - Methods preventing seed saving and replanting

### Why This Matters

Seeds are the foundation of agriculture and food security. The right of farmers
to save, exchange, and replant seeds is fundamental to:

- Global food security
- Farmer autonomy and livelihoods
- Agricultural biodiversity
- Sustainable farming systems

We believe plant breeding should serve humanity, not restrict it. Contributors
to Bijmantra share this commitment to ethical plant breeding that respects
farmers' rights and seed sovereignty.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at hello@bijmantra.org . All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Ethical Violations

Violations of the Ethical Use Policy are treated with the utmost seriousness:

- Immediate termination of all license rights
- Removal from the community
- Potential legal action

If you become aware of any use of Bijmantra for prohibited technologies, please
