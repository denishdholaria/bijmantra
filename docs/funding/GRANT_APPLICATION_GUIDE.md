### **Bijmantra: Open-Source Breeding Management for Global Food Security**

**The Problem:**
Plant breeders in developing countries lack access to integrated, affordable software tools. Commercial solutions cost $10,000-50,000/year, creating a digital divide that slows the development of improved crop varieties for 500 million smallholder farmers.

**Our Solution:**
Bijmantra is a comprehensive, open-source breeding management platform that unifies 11 divisions of agricultural science. With 100% BrAPI v2.1 compliance (201 endpoints), offline-first PWA architecture, and AI-powered analytics, it provides world-class breeding tools at zero cost.

**Impact:**
- **Direct:** Enable 100+ national breeding programs to modernize operations
- **Indirect:** Accelerate variety development for climate resilience
- **Long-term:** Contribute to global food security for 10 billion people by 2050

**Ask:**
$[AMOUNT] over [PERIOD] to complete development, deploy to beta users, and establish sustainable community governance.

**Team:**
Led by Denish Dholaria, with expertise in agricultural software, BrAPI standards, and open-source development.
