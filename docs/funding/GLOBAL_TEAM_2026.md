## Executive Summary

BijMantra preview-1 represents 18+ months of solo development — built in scraps of time, pushed forward one small step each day, funded by nothing but conviction.

To achieve its mission of unifying fragmented agricultural knowledge through AI-assisted cross-domain reasoning, the project must transition from a solo effort to a **globally distributed team**.

This document outlines the strategy for building that team in 2026.

### A Note on Reality

**We have no money to hire anyone.**

This is not a well-funded startup looking for contractors. This is an open source project built on borrowed time and stubborn hope. Every contributor who joins does so because they believe in the mission, not because there's a paycheck waiting.

If you're looking for compensation, we cannot offer it today. What we can offer:
- A platform that matters
- A community that values your work
- Recognition that lasts
- The satisfaction of building something real

> *"The measure of a life is not what we accumulate, but what we contribute. Plant every seed you carry."*

This project exists because one person refused to wait for permission or funding. It will grow because others choose to do the same.

### Why Global?

| Reason | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Climate Change is Global** | Solutions must work across climates, crops, and contexts |
| **Agricultural Knowledge is Distributed** | No single country holds all expertise |
| **24/7 Development** | Time zones enable continuous progress |
| **Diverse Perspectives** | Cross-cultural insights strengthen cross-domain reasoning |
| **Local Adaptation** | Regional experts ensure local relevance |

### 2026 Goal

**Build a core team of 15-25 contributors across 10+ countries, spanning 8+ disciplines.**

## Part 5: Communication & Collaboration

### 5.1 Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Discord** | Real-time chat, quick questions | Always on |
| **GitHub Discussions** | Design proposals, RFCs | As needed |
| **GitHub Issues** | Bug reports, feature requests | As needed |
| **Monthly All-Hands** | Updates, demos, Q&A | Monthly (recorded) |
| **Domain Syncs** | Module-specific coordination | Bi-weekly |
| **Governance Meetings** | Strategic decisions | Monthly |

### 5.2 Discord Server Structure

**Server:** [discord.gg/ubUHhBHjhG](https://discord.gg/ubUHhBHjhG)

#### Recommended Channels (Start Simple)

| Category | Channel | Topic |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **📢 Information** | `#welcome` | 🌱 Welcome to BijMantra — Cross-Domain Agricultural Intelligence. Star the repo, introduce yourself in #introductions |
| | `#announcements` | 📢 Project updates, releases, and news |
| **💬 Community** | `#introductions` | 👋 New here? Tell us: Who are you? Where are you from? What brings you to BijMantra? |
| | `#general` | 💬 General discussion about BijMantra, plant breeding, agriculture, open source |
| **🛠️ Development** | `#getting-started` | 🚀 New contributors start here! Setup help, good first issues. Read CONTRIBUTING.md |
| | `#help-and-support` | 🆘 Stuck on something? Ask here. No question too basic. |
| **🧬 Domains** | `#plant-breeding` | 🧬 Breeding workflows, genetics, crosses, selection. Domain experts welcome! |
| | `#ideas-and-feedback` | 💡 Feature ideas, UX feedback, roadmap suggestions |

**Principle:** Start with 8 channels. Add more only when conversations naturally need to split. Empty channels look worse than busy ones.

#### Language Policy

**Primary language: English**

This is not cultural preference — it's practical necessity for global collaboration. English is the common language of:
- Open source development
- Scientific publishing
- International agricultural research
- The internet

All official communication (code, docs, Discord, meetings) should be in English. This ensures:
- Everyone can participate in every conversation
- No one is excluded from decisions
- Knowledge is accessible to all contributors

**That said:** We welcome contributors whose English isn't perfect. Clarity matters more than grammar. If you can communicate your ideas, you belong here.

**Regional channels:** As the community grows, we may add language-specific channels (e.g., `#spanish`, `#hindi`) for casual conversation and local support. But official project communication remains in English.

### 5.3 Meeting Schedule (UTC-Friendly)

| Meeting | Time (UTC) | Frequency | Participants |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **All-Hands** | 14:00 UTC (rotating) | Monthly | Everyone |
| **Breeding Module** | 10:00 UTC | Bi-weekly | Breeding team |
| **Genomics Module** | 11:00 UTC | Bi-weekly | Genomics team |
| **Frontend Sync** | 15:00 UTC | Weekly | Frontend team |
| **Backend Sync** | 16:00 UTC | Weekly | Backend team |
| **Governance** | 14:00 UTC | Monthly | Council + Leads |

### 5.3 Async-First Principles

Given global distribution, we prioritize asynchronous communication:

1. **Document decisions** — All significant decisions in GitHub Discussions
2. **Record meetings** — All meetings recorded and summarized
3. **Overlap windows** — Identify 2-hour daily overlap for real-time needs
4. **Response expectations** — 24-48 hours for non-urgent matters
5. **No FOMO** — Summaries ensure no one misses critical updates

### 5.4 Language Policy

**Primary Language:** English (for code, docs, meetings)

**Supported Languages for Community:**
- Hindi (South Asia)
- Spanish (Latin America)
- French (Africa, Europe)
- Portuguese (Brazil, Lusophone Africa)
- Swahili (East Africa)
- Arabic (MENA)
- Mandarin (China)

**Translation Priority:**
1. User-facing documentation
2. Error messages
3. UI strings
4. Marketing materials

### 10.4 Funding Sources (Hope, Not Reality)

**Current funding received: $0**

No GitHub Sponsors. No Open Collective donations. Nothing.

The computer and office facilities used to build this project are borrowed from my day job. This project is built in personal time, on borrowed resources, with zero external funding.

| Source | Status | Reality |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **GitHub Sponsors** | Set up | $0 received to date |
| **Open Collective** | Set up | $0 received to date |
| **Grants** | Not yet applied | Requires time to write proposals |
| **Institutional Partners** | None | No conversations started |
| **In-Kind** | Day job facilities | Only current support |

**What we're pursuing (aspirations, not income):**

| Source | Hope | What It Would Take |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **GitHub Sponsors** | $500/month | Visibility, marketing we can't afford |
| **Open Collective** | $1,000/month | Same |
| **Agricultural Grants** | $25,000-100,000 | Time to write proposals, track record |
| **CGIAR/University Partners** | In-kind support | Relationships we haven't built yet |

**The honest path forward:**
1. Build something undeniably useful
2. Hope the right people find it
3. Keep pushing until something breaks through

## Final Words

> *"When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, 'I used everything you gave me.'"*
> — Erma Bombeck

This project exists because waiting for perfect conditions means waiting forever.

We have no funding. We have no team. We have no guarantees.

What we have is a platform that works, a mission that matters, and the stubborn belief that the right people will find their way here.

**If you're reading this and something resonates — reach out.**

Not because we can offer you anything today, but because together we might build something that feeds the world tomorrow.

> **"No single person can solve climate change. No single country can feed the world. No single discipline holds all the answers. But together, we can build the tools that help humanity adapt."**
