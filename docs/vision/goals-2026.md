## 🚧 Risks & Mitigation

### Top 5 Risks for 2026

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **1. Slow user adoption** | High | Critical | Free tier, training, partnerships |
| **2. Technical debt** | Medium | High | Refactoring sprints, code reviews |
| **3. Funding gap** | Medium | High | Grants, donations, consulting |
| **4. Burnout** | Medium | Critical | Hire help, take breaks, delegate |
| **5. Competition** | Low | Medium | Open source moat, innovation |

### Contingency Plans

**If user adoption is slow**:
- Pivot to specific niche (e.g., rice breeding)
- Offer free consulting to early adopters
- Partner with universities for pilot programs

**If funding runs out**:
- Reduce infrastructure costs (self-host)
- Delay hiring
- Seek emergency grants/loans

**If technical issues arise**:
- Hire contractors for specific problems
- Leverage open source community
- Simplify features if needed
