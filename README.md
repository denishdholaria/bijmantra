## 🙏 An Honest Note from the Creator

This platform represents **19+ months of solo development**. Over 330,000 lines of code. 354 pages. 1,644 API endpoints. 100% BrAPI v2.1 compatible. A dedicated domain at [bijmantra.org](https://bijmantra.org). All built by one person — not backed by any institution, not funded by any grant, and with zero external funding to date. The only material support has come from my employer, who generously allows me to use company hardware to develop this project alongside my day job — a gesture of goodwill that I am deeply grateful for, and without which this work would not have been possible.

In that time, this repository has been **cloned thousands of times**. People download it, explore it, try it. And then — silence. Not a single code contribution. Not a single bug report. Not a single feature suggestion. Not a single dime of funding. Not even a message saying *"this is interesting"* or *"this doesn't work."*

**I am not writing this to complain. I am writing this because the work itself matters.**

Climate change is accelerating. Crop yields are plateauing. Soil is degrading. Pest resistance is growing. The scientists working on these problems — breeders, agronomists, genomics researchers — are still forced to use fragmented, siloed tools that do not talk to each other. They manually reconcile data across Excel sheets, disconnected databases, and incompatible software.

BijMantra exists to fix that. **Not as a product. Not as a startup. As research infrastructure for the world.**

But one person cannot build the future of agricultural research alone. This project needs:

- **Your feedback** — even a GitHub issue saying "this page doesn't work" helps
- **Your expertise** — domain scientists who can validate that the algorithms are correct
- **Your code** — developers who can pick up a module and make it better
- **Your funding** — even small contributions keep the infrastructure running
- **Your voice** — sharing this project with someone who might care

If you've cloned this repo, if you've tried the app, if you've read this far — **please consider giving something back**. A star. An issue. A message. Anything.

**Climate change does not care about borders. Neither should our solutions.**

> ### 🔧 Active Refactoring Notice
>
> BijMantra is undergoing **significant architectural refactoring** as it transitions from proof-of-concept to production-grade infrastructure. During this period, you may encounter pages, features, or API endpoints that are partially implemented, pending backend wiring, or temporarily non-functional. **This is expected and intentional** — the codebase is being systematically rebuilt module by module.
>
> If something doesn't work, it is most likely on our radar. You can check the [CALF Assessment](docs/CALF_STATUS.md) for the current status of every page, or [open an issue](https://github.com/denishdholaria/bijmantra/issues) — we welcome every report.

## 🎯 Why BijMantra Exists

> **"Understanding one domain without seeing its interaction with others produces incomplete, sometimes misleading conclusions."**

Agricultural research is structurally fragmented. Breeders optimize genetics in isolation. Agronomists optimize management without genetic context. Soil scientists study soil without crop feedback. Climate scientists model risk without farm-level adaptation.

**Real-world agricultural decisions do not happen in silos — but our tools still do.**

| Traditional Tools        | BijMantra                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Data aggregation         | **Knowledge synthesis**           |
| Single-domain dashboards | **Cross-domain reasoning**        |
| AI as chatbot            | **AI as domain integrator**       |
| Tools for rich institutions | **Tools for the world**        |

BijMantra exists to bridge this gap: **a platform where AI assists reasoning across multiple scientific domains** — genetics, agronomy, soil science, climate, and economics — not just within them.

## 🧠 The BijMantra Mental Model (30 Seconds)

\`\`\`
Breeding Program → Trial Design → Phenotyping → Genomics → Selection Decisions
       ↕               ↕              ↕             ↕              ↕
    Soil Data     Climate Risk    Economics    Pest Pressure   Market Demand
\`\`\`

Most tools support **one box**. BijMantra connects the **entire flow** — and the interactions between them — into a single computational system.

## ⚠️ Reality Check: What Actually Works Today

**This section exists to prevent misunderstanding.** BijMantra believes in radical honesty. If you are evaluating this platform for research, funding, or contribution, read this carefully.

### CALF Assessment (February 2026)

CALF (Computational Analysis & Functionality Level) is our internal audit system. Every page is classified by what it actually does, not what it claims to do.

| CALF Level | Description | Count | % | Status |
|------------|-------------|-------|---|--------|
| **CALF-0** | Display Only | 95 | 27% | ✅ Acceptable |
| **CALF-1** | Client-Side Calculation | 76 | 21% | 🟡 Needs backend validation |
| **CALF-2** | Demo Data | **3** | **1%** | ✅ Nearly eliminated |
| **CALF-3** | Real Computation | 69 | 19% | ✅ Major improvement |
| **CALF-4** | WASM High-Performance | 5 | 1% | ✅ Excellent |
| — | Division Pages | 106 | 30% | Mixed |

**Progress since January 9, 2026:** CALF-2 (demo data) dropped from **42 pages to 3** (Vision module only). 39 pages converted to real database queries. Zero DEMO_* arrays remain in the backend. 8 demo service files deleted (−3,961 lines), 7 API files rewritten to real DB queries (+1,429 lines).

## 💰 This Project Needs Your Support

<div align="center">

### The Reality of Building for the World — Alone

</div>

BijMantra is built for **every agricultural researcher on the planet** — not just those at well-funded institutions in wealthy countries. A plant breeder in sub-Saharan Africa deserves the same computational tools as one at a European university. An agronomist in rural India should have access to the same cross-domain intelligence as a CGIAR center.

**But building global research infrastructure costs money.** Domain registration, cloud hosting, CI/CD compute, SSL certificates, search infrastructure, database hosting — these are real, recurring costs that one person's savings cannot sustain indefinitely.

### What Funding Enables

| Need | Monthly Cost | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | ~$200 | PostgreSQL, Redis, Meilisearch, object storage |
| **Domain & SSL** | ~$15 | [bijmantra.org](https://bijmantra.org) stays alive |
| **CI/CD Minutes** | ~$20 | Automated testing on every code change |
| **Full-Time Development** | — | Creator can focus on this instead of contract work |

### How to Fund

| Channel | Link |
|---------|------|
| 💖 **GitHub Sponsors** | [github.com/sponsors/denishdholaria](https://github.com/sponsors/denishdholaria) |
| 💰 **Open Collective** | [opencollective.com/bijmantra](https://opencollective.com/bijmantra) |

**Every contribution is publicly tracked.** Open Collective provides full financial transparency — all income and expenses are visible.

### Institutional Partners Welcome

We actively seek partnerships with organizations that understand that **agricultural research infrastructure is a global public good**:

- **CGIAR Centers** — IRRI, CIMMYT, ICRISAT, ICARDA, and others
- **Philanthropic Foundations** — Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, McKnight Foundation
- **Government Agencies** — USAID, DFID, GIZ, ICAR, EMBRAPA
- **Universities** — Any institution running plant breeding programs
- **Private Sector** — Seed companies and AgTech firms who benefit from open standards

> 📄 **[FUNDING.md](FUNDING.md)** — Detailed funding tiers, use of funds, and UN SDG alignment

## 👥 Who BijMantra Is For

**BijMantra is for:**

- Plant breeders running real breeding programs (public or private, any country)
- Researchers tired of siloed tools and CSV glue between systems
- Institutions that value correctness over dashboards
- Developers interested in scientific computing + modern web architecture
- Anyone who believes agricultural tools should be accessible to all

**BijMantra is NOT for:**

- Quick demo seekers expecting a polished SaaS product
- Pure visualization / dashboard-only use cases
- "AI chatbot for agriculture" expectations
- Production deployment (yet — wait for `1.0.0`)

---

## 🧩 What Makes BijMantra Technically Unusual

Most agricultural software does one thing. BijMantra does something different:

- **Fortran-based numerical kernels** in a web-first platform (BLUP, REML, kinship matrices)
- **WASM genomics** running inside the browser — not server-side (Rust → WebAssembly)
- **Row-Level Security** as a first-class architectural primitive (103 tables)
- **Offline-capable data collection** — field data entry works without internet connectivity
- **100% BrAPI v2.1 compatible** — 201/201 endpoints for global interoperability
- **Cross-domain AI reasoning** — breeding decisions surface soil, climate, and economic factors
- **Governance documents treated as executable constraints** — 14-document Platform Law Stack
- **Multi-language compute stack** — Python (API/ML), Rust/WASM (genomics matrices), Fortran (BLUP/REML)

## 🌍 A Note About Global Equity

<div align="center">

**Climate change does not care about borders.**

**Neither does hunger. Neither does soil degradation. Neither should our tools.**

</div>

The most advanced agricultural software in the world sits behind institutional paywalls, requires expensive licenses, or assumes infrastructure that does not exist in most of the world. A researcher in Niger, a breeder in Bangladesh, a seed bank curator in Peru — they face the same scientific challenges as their counterparts at well-funded Western institutions, but with a fraction of the tools.

BijMantra is **open source by conviction, not by convenience**. The AGPL-3.0 license ensures that improvements flow back to the community. The BrAPI v2.1 compatible ensures interoperability with every other breeding database in the world. The PWA architecture ensures it works on the devices people actually have — including offline, because not every field has internet.

This is not charity. This is engineering for reality.

## 🏛️ Governance & Architecture

BijMantra is governed by a formal **Platform Law Stack** — 14 binding documents organized in 7 layers.

See **[PLATFORM_LAW_INDEX.md](docs/architecture/PLATFORM_LAW_INDEX.md)** for the complete framework.

> The README describes _intent and status_. `ARCHITECTURE.md` defines _system truth_. In case of conflict, architecture documents prevail.

| Layer               | Purpose                                                  |

## 🌟 Vision

> **"Agricultural truth emerges at the intersection of disciplines. BijMantra makes that intersection computable."**

**Bij** (बीज) = Seed · **Mantra** (मन्त्र) = Sacred Utterance ; The primordial sound (The Big Bang) from which the universes were seeded.

This platform exists because better tools lead to better science, better science leads to better agriculture, and better agriculture feeds the world.
