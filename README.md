### The Road Ahead

This platform represents 18+ months of solo development — but the vision extends far beyond what one person can build. BijMantra aims to transform how agricultural research is conducted globally, connecting fragmented domains into unified intelligence.

**What's built:** 230 pages, 1,475 endpoints, 8 modules, 100% BrAPI v2.1 compliance.

**What remains:** Converting 42 pages from demo data to real database queries, implementing missing algorithms, and domain expert validation.

We're seeking collaborators who understand that meaningful work takes time, and that the best software emerges from the intersection of technical excellence and domain expertise.

### ⚠️ Reality Check: What Actually Works Today

**This section exists to prevent misunderstanding.** If you are evaluating BijMantra for research, funding, or contribution, read this carefully before proceeding.

**CALF Assessment (January 2026) revealed critical issues:**

| CALF Level                | Count  | %       | Status           |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| Display Only              | 89     | 40%     | ✅ Acceptable    |
| Client-Side Calculation   | 67     | 30%     | ⚠️ Needs backend |
| **Demo Data (Violation)** | **42** | **19%** | **🔴 Critical**  |
| Real Computation          | 18     | 8%      | ⚠️ Mixed         |
| WASM High-Performance     | 5      | 2%      | ✅ Excellent     |

**Critical Finding:** Only **23 pages (10%)** are fully functional with real computation.

## 🎯 Why BijMantra Exists

> **"Understanding one domain without seeing its interaction with others produces incomplete, sometimes misleading conclusions."**

Agricultural research is fragmented. Breeders optimize genetics in isolation. Agronomists optimize management without genetic context. Soil scientists study soil without crop feedback.

**Real-world agricultural decisions do not happen in silos — but our tools still do.**

BijMantra exists to solve this: **a platform where AI assists reasoning across multiple scientific domains**, not just within them.

| Traditional Tools        | BijMantra                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Data aggregation         | **Knowledge synthesis**     |
| Single-domain dashboards | **Cross-domain reasoning**  |
| AI as chatbot            | **AI as domain integrator** |

---

## 🧠 The BijMantra Mental Model (30 Seconds)

```
Breeding Program → Trial Design → Phenotyping → Genomics → Selection Decisions
```

Most tools support **one box**. BijMantra connects the **entire flow** into a single computational system.

---

## 👥 Who BijMantra Is For (and Who It Is Not)

**BijMantra is for:**

- Plant breeders running real programs (public or private)
- Researchers tired of siloed tools and CSV glue
- Institutions that value correctness over dashboards
- Developers interested in scientific computing + PWA systems

**BijMantra is NOT for:**

- Quick demo seekers
- Pure visualization tools
- "AI chatbot for agriculture" expectations
- Production SaaS users (yet)

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals (Current Phase)

BijMantra does not currently aim to:

- Be a turnkey SaaS product
- Replace statistical software like ASReml or SAS
- Provide black-box AI recommendations
- Optimize for casual or demo-first usage

## 🧩 What Makes BijMantra Technically Unusual

- **Fortran-based numerical kernels** in a web-first platform (BLUP, REML, kinship matrices)
- **WASM genomics** running inside the browser (not server-side)
- **Row-Level Security** as a first-class architectural primitive (103 tables)
- **Offline-first breeding workflows** (not just read-only caching)
- **Governance documents treated as executable constraints** (14-document Platform Law Stack)
- **100% BrAPI v2.1 compliance** (201/201 endpoints)

## 🏛️ Governance & Architecture

BijMantra is governed by a formal **Platform Law Stack** — 14 binding documents organized in 7 layers.

See **[PLATFORM_LAW_INDEX.md](docs/architecture/PLATFORM_LAW_INDEX.md)** for the complete framework.

> The README describes _intent and status_. `ARCHITECTURE.md` defines _system truth_. In case of conflict, architecture documents prevail.

| Layer               | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Foundation          | Evidence-based review (GOVERNANCE.md)                    |
| Architecture        | System shape, data truth                                 |
| External Law        | BrAPI, MCPD, interoperability standards                  |
| Internal Law        | Domain boundaries, schema governance, AI constraints     |
| Operations & Change | Module acceptance, operational playbook, release process |
| Resilience & Memory | Risk mitigation, ADR framework                           |
| Culture             | Contributor onboarding, mindset                          |

> **This is not advisory documentation. This is operational law.**
