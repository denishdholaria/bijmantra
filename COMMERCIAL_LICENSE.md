classification of the country where the institution is headquartered.
**Individual researcher use remains FREE in all tiers** (see LICENSE
Section 2.3).

#### Tier 1: Low-Income Countries

**Status: FREE FOREVER**

All educational and research institutions headquartered in countries
classified as "Low Income" by the World Bank may use the Software
without any fees, regardless of institution size, budget, or use case.

*Examples: Ethiopia, Uganda, Afghanistan, Haiti, Burkina Faso, Mali*

#### Tier 2: Lower-Middle Income Countries

**Status: FREE for first 3 years, then minimal fees**

Grace Period: Years 1–3 from first institutional deployment — FREE

After Grace Period (Year 4+):

| Institution Size (Ag Research Budget) | Annual Fee |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Small (< $5,000,000 USD) | FREE |
| Medium ($5M – $50M USD) | $2,500 |
| Large (> $50,000,000 USD) | $5,000 |

*Examples: India, Kenya, Vietnam, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines*

#### Tier 3: Upper-Middle Income Countries

**Status: FREE for first year, then moderate fees**

Grace Period: Year 1 from first institutional deployment — FREE

After Grace Period (Year 2+):

| Institution Size (Ag Research Budget) | Annual Fee |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Small (< $10,000,000 USD) | FREE |
| Medium ($10M – $50M USD) | $5,000 |
| Large (> $50,000,000 USD) | $10,000 |

*Examples: USA, Canada, EU countries, UK, Japan, Australia, Switzerland*

Fee determination within ranges is based on: total institutional research
budget, number of departments using the Software, level of integration
with institutional systems, and support requirements.

#### Grace Period Mechanics

**(a) Start Date:** Grace period begins on the date of first institutional
deployment (centralized deployment across multiple labs or departments).
Individual researcher use does NOT trigger the grace period.

**(b) Notification:** Institutions must notify the Licensor of first
institutional deployment within 30 days. Send to: hello@bijmantra.org
with subject "Institutional Deployment Notice".

**(c) Transition Notice:** At end of grace period, institutions receive
90-day advance notice before fees apply.

**(d) Hardship Extension:** Institutions may request grace period extension
due to financial hardship, natural disasters, political instability, or
other extraordinary circumstances. Requests reviewed quarterly; extensions
of up to 2 additional years may be granted.

**(e) No Retroactive Fees:** Fees only apply prospectively after grace
period ends and 90-day notice is provided.

**(f) Verification:** Institutions self-report their tier and research
budget. The Licensor may request verification using publicly available
data (institutional reports, USDA NIFA data, NSF HERD Survey, etc.).

### 3.7 Multi-Year Commitment Discount

| Commitment Term | Discount on Annual Fee |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 3-year commitment | 20% off |
| 5-year commitment | 30% off |

Payment may be annual or upfront. Multi-year discounts may be combined
with consortium discounts.

### 3.8 Hardship Waiver

Institutions facing extraordinary financial hardship may apply for fee
waivers or reductions, regardless of geographic tier. Applications are
reviewed quarterly.

Development requires sustainable funding. The Sponsorship Program allows
institutions to support open agricultural research while receiving
tangible benefits and significant long-term cost savings.
