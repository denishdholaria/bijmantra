## PREAMBLE

Bijmantra is built on the conviction that agricultural technology should
serve farmers, food security, and the long-term health of our planet's
agricultural systems. This Ethical Use Policy exists to ensure that the
Software is never used to undermine these values.

This Policy is **legally binding** and is incorporated by reference into
the main LICENSE. Violation of this Policy results in **immediate and
automatic termination** of all license rights, whether under the Open
Source License (AGPL-3.0) or any Commercial License.

---

## 1. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

The following uses of the Software are **absolutely prohibited** under
any circumstances, without exception, and regardless of license type:

### 1.1 Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs)

The Software may NOT be used, directly or indirectly, in the research,
development, testing, production, deployment, or commercialization of
any Genetic Use Restriction Technology (GURT), including but not limited
to:

**(a) V-GURTs (Variety-Level GURTs / "Terminator Technology")**

Technologies that produce seeds or plant propagules that are sterile,
non-viable, or incapable of germination, including:

- Genetic modifications that cause seed sterility
- Technologies that prevent embryo development
- Modifications that cause seed abortion
- Any mechanism designed to prevent farmers from saving and replanting seeds

**(b) T-GURTs (Trait-Level GURTs / "Traitor Technology")**

Technologies that require application of proprietary chemicals, compounds,
or external inputs to activate, maintain, or express genetic traits,
including:

- Chemically-induced gene expression systems for commercial trait control
- Technologies requiring proprietary "activator" compounds
- Conditional trait expression dependent on purchased inputs
- Any mechanism creating chemical dependency for trait function

**(c) Seed Termination Technologies**

Any technology, method, process, or practice designed or intended to:

- Prevent seeds from being saved for replanting
- Prevent seeds from being shared, exchanged, or sold by farmers
- Prevent seeds from being used for subsequent generations
- Reduce seed viability over successive generations
- Create artificial dependency on seed purchases

### 1.2 Biological Weapons and Harmful Applications

The Software may NOT be used in connection with:

- Development of biological weapons or agents
- Creation of plant pathogens or pests
- Deliberate harm to agricultural systems
- Bioterrorism or agricultural sabotage

### 1.3 Deceptive Practices

The Software may NOT be used to:

- Falsify breeding records or pedigree data
- Misrepresent variety characteristics
- Commit fraud in seed certification
- Deceive farmers about seed quality or origin

---

## 2. RATIONALE

### 2.1 Why These Prohibitions Exist

**Farmer Sovereignty**: For millennia, farmers have saved, selected, and
shared seeds. This practice is fundamental to agricultural resilience,
biodiversity, and farmer autonomy. Technologies that prevent seed saving
threaten this foundation.

**Food Security**: Seed termination technologies create dependency on
corporate seed supplies. In times of crisis—economic, political, or
environmental—this dependency threatens food security.

**Biodiversity**: Farmer seed saving and selection is a primary driver
of crop genetic diversity. Technologies that eliminate this practice
accelerate genetic erosion.

**Equity**: Seed termination technologies disproportionately harm
smallholder farmers in developing countries who cannot afford to purchase
new seeds every season.

**Precautionary Principle**: The long-term ecological and social
consequences of widespread GURT deployment are unknown and potentially
irreversible.

### 2.2 Scientific and Policy Context

These prohibitions align with:

- **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)**: De facto moratorium on
  field testing and commercial sale of terminator seeds (Decision V/5)

- **International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and
  Agriculture (ITPGRFA)**: Recognition of farmers' rights to save, use,
  exchange, and sell farm-saved seed

- **UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants**: Right to save, use,
  exchange, and sell farm-saved seed and propagating material

- **Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety**: Precautionary approach to
  biotechnology

## 3. SCOPE AND APPLICATION

### 3.1 What "Use" Means

For purposes of this Policy, "use" includes:

- Running the Software
- Incorporating the Software into other systems
- Using outputs or data generated by the Software
- Modifying or creating derivative works
- Distributing the Software or derivatives
- Providing services based on the Software

### 3.2 Direct and Indirect Use

This Policy prohibits both:

**(a) Direct Use**: Using the Software itself for prohibited purposes

**(b) Indirect Use**: Using the Software as part of a larger system,
workflow, or enterprise that includes prohibited activities, even if
the Software itself is not directly involved in those activities

**Example**: A company that develops terminator seeds may not use
Bijmantra for ANY purpose, including unrelated breeding programs,
because the organization as a whole is engaged in prohibited activities.

### 3.3 Knowledge Standard

Violation occurs when You:

- Know that Your use involves prohibited activities; OR
- Have reason to know (would know upon reasonable inquiry); OR
- Are willfully ignorant of facts that would reveal prohibited activities

---

## 4. CERTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE

### 4.1 Certification

By using the Software, You certify that:

**(a)** You are not currently engaged in, and have not within the past
five (5) years been engaged in, the research, development, testing,
production, or commercialization of any technology described in Section 1.

**(b)** You will not use the Software, or permit the Software to be used,
in connection with any technology described in Section 1.

**(c)** You will not transfer, license, sell, or otherwise make the
Software available to any party that You know or have reason to believe
is engaged in activities described in Section 1.

**(d)** If You become aware that the Software is being used in connection
with prohibited activities, You will immediately cease such use and
notify the Licensor.

### 4.2 Compliance Monitoring

The Licensor reserves the right to:

- Request certification of compliance
- Investigate credible reports of violations
- Require documentation of use cases
- Conduct audits (for Commercial Licensees)

### 4.3 Reporting Violations
